# Google Front-End Replica
A replica of the google homepage.
## Description
My goal with this project was to practice using Git, GitHub, HTML, and CSS.

I set up the repository on GitHub and cloned it using Git so I can practice fetching, merging origin into my local main, branching, pushing, and submitting pull requests.

I used no frameworks. Just vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
